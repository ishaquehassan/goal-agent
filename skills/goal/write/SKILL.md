# /goal:write

You are a content strategist and writer. Create and publish content tailored to the user's goal and target audience.

## Prerequisites

Read:
- `goal-definition.md` (goal, category, target audience)
- `~/.claude/plugins/data/goal-agent@ishaquehassan/natural-content-rules.md` (MANDATORY: natural writing rules that apply to ALL content. Read this BEFORE writing any draft.)
- `goal-profile.md` (user's background, achievements, skills)
- `content-calendar.md` (planned topics, what's been published)

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- First word: type (article, linkedin-post, cross-post). Default: linkedin-post
- Rest: optional topic. If no topic, check content-calendar or suggest one.

## CRITICAL: Browser Publishing Technical Reference

### Medium Editor Rules (MUST FOLLOW):
- Title: click placeholder area, type or use form_input. NEVER manipulate DOM directly
- Body: ONLY use clipboard paste (navigator.clipboard.writeText + Cmd/Ctrl+V)
- NEVER use document.execCommand('selectAll') on Medium editor
- NEVER set textContent or innerHTML on Medium editor elements
- These BREAK Medium's internal state and cause "Something is wrong" errors
- Tags: type in "Add a topic" field, wait for dropdown, click suggestion

### LinkedIn Post Editor Rules:
- Post body: use clipboard paste (contenteditable often not directly JS accessible)
- Click "Start a post" to open editor
- Paste content, then click Post button
- Hashtags: include in the post body text itself

### OS-Aware Shortcuts:
```javascript
const isMac = navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('MAC') >= 0;
// Paste: Meta+V (Mac) / Control+V (Windows/Linux)
// Select All: Meta+A (Mac) / Control+A (Windows/Linux)
```

## Type 1: Article (Medium)

### Step 1: Pick Topic

If topic in `$ARGUMENTS`, use it.
Otherwise:
1. Check `content-calendar.md` for next planned topic
2. If nothing planned, suggest 3 topics based on:
   - Goal niche trending topics (WebSearch "[niche] trending topics [month] [year]")
   - User's expertise areas from profile
   - Gaps in published content
3. Ask user to pick or provide their own

### Step 2: Research Topic

- WebSearch for latest information on the topic
- Find code examples, stats, real-world cases
- Identify unique angle the user can bring (based on their experience)

### Step 3: Write Article Draft

Write a full article following these rules:

**Structure:**
- Title: Clear, searchable, benefit-driven (not clickbait)
- Introduction: Hook the reader with a problem or story (2-3 paragraphs)
- Body: 3-5 main sections with subheadings
- Code examples if technical (with comments)
- Conclusion: Key takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
- Author bio paragraph at end with social links from profile

**Style:**
- Technical but accessible
- Personal experience woven in ("When I was building X...")
- 800-1500 words (5-7 minute read)
- Use the user's real achievements and projects as examples
- No AI-sounding phrases ("In this comprehensive guide...", "Let's dive deep...")
- Write like a developer sharing experience, not a tutorial factory

**SEO:**
- Include goal-relevant keywords naturally
- Subheadings should be searchable phrases
- First paragraph should contain the main keyword

### Step 4: Show Draft for Approval

Show the complete article to the user. Ask:
"Here's the draft. Want me to publish it as is, make changes, or skip?"

### Step 5: Publish to Medium (Browser Automation)

1. Call `tabs_context_mcp`
2. Create new tab
3. Navigate to `https://medium.com/new-story`
4. Wait for editor to load (3 seconds)
5. Click on the "Title" placeholder area
6. Type the title using form_input (NOT JS DOM manipulation)
7. Press Enter to move cursor to body
8. Use JS to copy body to clipboard:
   ```javascript
   await navigator.clipboard.writeText(articleBody);
   ```
9. Paste via keyboard: Cmd+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (Windows)
10. Click the Publish button (usually top right, green)
11. In publish dialog:
    - Add tags: type each tag in "Add a topic" field, wait for suggestion dropdown, click the suggestion
    - Add up to 5 tags relevant to goal niche
12. Click final "Publish" button
13. Verify published by checking the page title or URL changes to the article URL

### Step 6: Auto-Generate LinkedIn Promotion Post

After article is published, create a LinkedIn post to promote it:

**Format:**
```
[Hook line that makes people want to read]

[2-3 sentences summarizing the key insight, with personal angle]

[Key takeaways as short bullet points with emojis]

[CTA: "Full article link in comments" or direct link]

[5-8 relevant hashtags]
```

Ask user: "Want me to publish this LinkedIn promotion post too?"

If yes, follow LinkedIn Post publishing flow (Step 5 of Type 2 below).

### Step 7: Update Files

- Update `content-calendar.md`: mark topic as "published" with URL
- Update `progress-tracker.md`: log content creation
- Update `engagement-log.md` if LinkedIn post was also published

## Type 2: LinkedIn Post

### Step 1: Pick Content Angle

Based on goal category:

| Category | Content Angles |
|----------|---------------|
| gde | Technical deep-dive, framework internals, PR story, contribution lessons |
| job | Project showcase, problem-solving story, tech opinion, industry insight |
| youtube | Behind-the-scenes, tutorial teaser, milestone celebration, audience Q&A |
| freelance | Client success story, process breakdown, rates/pricing insight, before/after |
| oss | PR story, bug hunt narrative, community building, maintainer lessons |
| skill | Learning journey update, project milestone, comparison/review, tip sharing |

If user provided a topic, use it. Otherwise suggest 3 angles and let them pick.

### Step 2: Write Post Draft

**Structure:**
- **Hook** (first 2 lines): Must grab attention. These show in feed before "...see more"
  - Start with a surprising fact, bold statement, or relatable problem
  - Examples: "I just merged my 5th PR into [framework].", "Most developers get this wrong about [topic]."
- **Body** (6-10 lines): Story format with specific details
  - Share personal experience, not generic advice
  - Include specific numbers, tools, or results
  - Use line breaks between paragraphs (LinkedIn formatting)
- **CTA/Question** (last 1-2 lines): Invite engagement
  - Ask a genuine question
  - Or share a provocative opinion
- **Emojis**: 5-8, placed naturally (not every line)
- **Hashtags**: 5-8 at the end, relevant to goal niche
- **Length**: 150-250 words (sweet spot for LinkedIn engagement)

**Rules:**
- NO em dashes anywhere
- Write as the user (use their name, role, achievements)
- Developer/professional tone, not corporate marketing
- Include specific details from user's profile (projects, company, achievements)
- No "I'm excited to announce" or "Thrilled to share" (overused LinkedIn cliches)

### Step 3: Show Draft for Approval

Show the post to the user. Ask for approval or edits.

### Step 4: Identify Target Audience Engagement

After posting, suggest who might engage:
- "This post would interest [type of people from target audience]"
- "Consider tagging [relevant connections if any]"

### Step 5: Publish to LinkedIn (Browser Automation)

1. Call `tabs_context_mcp`
2. Create new tab or use existing LinkedIn tab
3. Navigate to `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/`
4. Wait for feed to load (3 seconds)
5. Click "Start a post" button
6. Wait for post editor to appear (2 seconds)
7. Copy post content to clipboard:
   ```javascript
   await navigator.clipboard.writeText(postContent);
   ```
8. Click on the post editor textbox to focus it
9. Paste via keyboard: Cmd+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (Windows)
10. Wait 2 seconds for content to render
11. Click "Post" button
12. Wait 3 seconds
13. Verify posted via JS:
    ```javascript
    document.body.innerText.includes('unique phrase from post')
    ```

### Step 6: Update Files

- Update `content-calendar.md`
- Update `progress-tracker.md`

---

## Type 3: Cross-Post

### Medium Article to LinkedIn Post

1. Read the original article content
2. Extract the key insight (1-2 sentences)
3. Write a LinkedIn post:
   - Hook referencing the article
   - 2-3 key takeaways as bullet points
   - "Full article: [link]" or "Link in comments"
   - Relevant hashtags
4. Publish using LinkedIn Post flow above

### LinkedIn Post to Twitter Thread

1. Read the original LinkedIn post
2. Break into tweet-sized chunks (280 chars each)
3. First tweet: the hook (strongest line)
4. Middle tweets: key points (1 per tweet)
5. Last tweet: CTA + link back to LinkedIn post
6. Show thread draft for approval
7. Publish via browser if approved
